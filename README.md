# Appointment-Booking-System
It's a Desktop Application used by Attendant to book patient's appointment instead of maintaining paper-based databases.

The basic idea behind the project is, it lets attendant book patient's appointment for a particular doctor visiting hospital and backend does the necessary checking for slots and making entries in database.

This Project is made using Java, more specifically, Swing, JDBC and MySQL.

## Some advantages of computerized database over paper-based database

1. Very fast to find a specific record.
2. Can be used to analyse the data.
3. Can easily update or amend a record.
4. Records are stored safely, they are available when needed.
5. The database can be kept secure by use of passwords and many more....

## How does this project works ?

Consider each doctor can treat a maximum of 5 patients per day at a particular hospital and there are no appointments booked currently.

1. Select required medical field.

2. After selecting required field, say Cardiology, select the required doctor.

3. After selecting the required doctor, the backend will check for the availability of slot in that doctorâ€™s table in database. 

4. **Condition** - If the no. of entries of the current date is less than 5 then attendant will enter the required information and appointment will be booked successfully.

5. Database table:

6. If no. of entries of the current date becomes equal to 5 then appointment is not booked.
